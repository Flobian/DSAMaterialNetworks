# Network Science Summer School
Teaching Material for Summer School on Network Science for High School Students


We give the worksheets and some additional teaching material that we used for a summer school on Network Science for high school students.

The worksheets are given in the original German version and a translated English one.

The topics of the sheets are

| Worksheet  | Topic| Details |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----- |
| 1 | Introduction into Network Theory  | Creating graphs with Python and analysing them |
| 2 | Graph Colouring | Node and edge colouring, coding greedy colouring algorithm|
| 3 | Matrix Calculations and Effective Resistance |Eigenvalues, Laplace matrix |
| 4 | Contagion Dynamics | SI model, vaccination, betweenness centrality|
| 5 | Dynamical Systems | Verhulst dynamic, ODE, linear stability|
| 6 | Lotka-Volterra Equations and Fractals| Euler method, drawing Lindenmeyer-systems with python|


Most of the problems were created by us. Some of them were adapted or inspired from various sources, including:

- Geir Agnarsson, and Raymond Greenlaw. Graph Theory: Modeling, Applications, and Algorithms. Prentice-Hall, Inc., 2006.

- Steven H. Strogatz. Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos: with Applications to Physics, Biology, Chemistry, and Engineering. Westview Press, 2014.

- Mark Newman. Networks: An Introduction. Oxford University Press, 2010.

- Material from the University of Oxford undergraduate course `B8.5 Graph Theory`

A manuscript explaining in more details our experience is under Review by the journal *Network Science*. You can find the manuscript http://www.dtc.ox.ac.uk/people/14/klimmf/manuscripts/2017KlimmMaier_NetworkScienceSummerSchool_Manuscript.pdf "here".

Some of the graph plots were created with the tikz-network package https://github.com/hackl/tikz-network

If you have general questions, please open an issue on Github or email Florian Klimm.
