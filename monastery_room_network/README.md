# Rossleben Monastery Room Network

This is a network of adjacent rooms in the Rossleben monastery 
building. Nodes denote rooms, halls and staircases; edges 
are doors between them. Nodes starting with A, B, C, or D are
normal rooms or halls in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th floor, respectively.
Nodes starting with N, E, S, W are staircases connecting the floors.
The node Y is the yard.

The network consists of N = 160 nodes and m = 188 edges.

The original network in the `.txt`-file includes some odd
node names which are cleared up in the `.graphml`- and `.edgelist`-files
